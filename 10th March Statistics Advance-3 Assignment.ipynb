    "Ans: Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the estimation of population parameters\n",
    "from sample data. Estimation involves the use of point estimates and interval estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "A point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate a population parameter. It is usually the \n",

    "An interval estimate is a range of values that is used to estimate a population parameter. It is usually \n",
    "constructed using the sample statistic and some measure of its variability, such as the standard error or \n",
